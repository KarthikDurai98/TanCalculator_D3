# Tangent Calculator

## Overview
The Tangent Calculator is a JavaFX application designed to calculate the tangent of angles in both degrees and radians accurately. It features a user-friendly interface that supports seamless interaction and robust functionality, ensuring precise computations and effective error handling.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive GUI for entering angles and selecting units.
- **Support for Multiple Units**: Calculates tangents using either degrees or radians.
- **Real-Time Validation**: Ensures the validity of user inputs to prevent errors.
- **Calculation History**: Maintains a log of recent calculations for easy reference.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaFX**: For creating the graphical user interface.
- **JUnit**: Used for comprehensive unit testing to validate functionality and edge cases.
- **SonarLint**: Integrates directly into the IDE for continuous code quality checks.
- **Sun Checkstyle**: Ensures adherence to coding standards and best practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Java and JavaFX installed on your machine. 

### Installation
